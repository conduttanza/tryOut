# Helios – MediaPipe Hand Gesture Recognition in Python

**Helios** is a Python computer vision project that uses **Google MediaPipe** to
perform **real-time hand tracking and hand gesture recognition** via a webcam.

The project is designed for **human–computer interaction**, gesture-based input,
and experimentation with **MediaPipe Hands** and **OpenCV**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time **hand detection and tracking**
- **Hand gesture recognition** using MediaPipe
- Webcam input via **OpenCV**
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly
- Suitable for HCI, automation, and computer vision experiments

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Helios uses **MediaPipe Hands**, a machine-learning based framework developed by
Google, to detect 21 hand landmarks per hand in real time.

These landmarks are processed to:
- track finger positions
- recognize hand poses
- detect simple gestures
